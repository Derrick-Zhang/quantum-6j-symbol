# quantum-6j-symbol
Mathematica files for SO(N) quantum 6j symbols

## current problems
- ~~Need to slightly modify~~
   - ~~SO-6-double-box-fusion-matrix.nb~~
   - ~~SU-N-symmetric-rep-fusion-matrix.nb~~
   - ~~classical-SO-N-6j-symbol.nb~~

- ~~Generalize the fusion matrix for SO(N)~~
   - ~~add the first row and the first column which is known~~
   - ~~add the last row and the last column~~
   - ~~using orthonomality property to determine other entries.~~
   
 - ~~Quantize the SO(N) 6j symbol in Alisauskas' paper~~
    - ~~program equation (2.1) in the paper~~
    - ~~try to quantize it!~~
    
## optional direction
- SO(N) triple box fusion matrix
   - ~~obtain the fusion rule for triple boxes, using LieART~~
   - plug in the entries corresponding to symmetric representations, 
   using the SO(N) quantum 6j symbol for symmetric representations
   - solve for the other entires, using the fact that each entry is proportional to the square root
   of the quantum dimensions of representations that the row and column corresponds to
   - calculate the Kauffman polynomial, using this triple box fusion matrix
   
## ultimate goal
find the close expression of quantum 6j symbol for each entries in the fusion matrix, not just for entries corresponding to symmmetric representations.
