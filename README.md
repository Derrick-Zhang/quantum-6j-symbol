# quantum-6j-symbol
Mathematica files for SO(N) quantum 6j symbols

## current problems
- ~~Need to slightly modify~~
   - ~~SO-6-double-box-fusion-matrix.nb~~
   - ~~SU-N-symmetric-rep-fusion-matrix.nb~~
   - ~~classical-SO-N-6j-symbol.nb~~

- ~~Generalize the fusion matrix for SO(N)~~
   - ~~add the first row and the first column which is known~~
   - ~~add the last row and the last column~~
   - ~~using orthonomality property to determine other entries.~~
   
 - Quantize the SO(N) 6j symbol in Alisauskas' paper
    - ~~program equation (2.1) in the paper~~
    - try to quantize it!
